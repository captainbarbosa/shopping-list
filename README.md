# Shopping List

Makes your list and checks it twice.

This is a collection of four Python functions that create and edit a shopping list.  

Here is what each function does:    
  1) Creates a list from a user's repeated input. List ends when nothing is entered.    
  2) Sorts the user's list in alphabetical order using a bubble sort algorithm    
  3) Removes duplicate items from the user's shopping list to create a list stripped of identical items.    
  4) Reports the original and stripped shopping lists, and reports a final count of duplicates found.   
  
  To try it out, download the file and run it on your local machine.
